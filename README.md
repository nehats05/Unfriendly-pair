# Unfriendly-pair
N numbers and M unfriendly pairs, divide them so that every unfriendly pair is separated.
For instance, N=3 and {(1,2),(2,3),(3,1)} represent unfriendly pairs, it is imppossible to divide numbers into two groups to keep the unfriendly pair separated.
If N=4 and {(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,1)} represent unfriendly pairs, we can divide them into two groups of (1,3) and (2,4) so that all unfrinedly pairs are separated.
For given N numbers and M unfriendly pair,decide whether you can divide them into two groups so that unfriendly pair are separated.
